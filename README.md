## notify_me
Android offers several options for scheduling tasks to run at specific times, such as WorkManager, JobScheduler, and AlarmManager + BroadcastReceivers. However, due to the complexities involved, it can be challenging to choose the best method, especially with the added complication of doze mode.

In this app, I will demonstrate the approach I used in my app Notify Me, which utilizes AlarmManager + BroadcastReceivers to send daily reminder-notifications at a specific time.
